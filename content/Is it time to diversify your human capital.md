Is it time to diversify your human capital?

When I was in college the typical advice from economists in particular was “specialize your labor/human capital and diversify your investments.” Ken Elzinga is someone who gave out that advice and lives it. 

In other words, get an advanced degree into an in-demand profession and train for a niche skill within that. Oh and invest in index funds.

But I feel like that’s changing now? (I do still like low cost index funds)

Because of AI, it seems much *harder* to know what specialized skills are going to be valuable in 5 or 10 years (let alone 40!) 

Because of AI, it’s also *easier* to try new human-capital-related skills and projects. [[AI lowers the fixed cost of trying something new]]

Openness, flexibility, range all seem more important.  [[If AI makes work more bimodal - I want to be the top bucket]]

I supposes that someone like Ken Elzinga did have to figure out technological shifts in personal computing and the internet. Like you don’t need a typist anymore. But also he still used the overhead projector until what, 2018? And then only because of being forced out of the old lecture hall (McLeod I think) due to construction! Will it be possible to avoid *this* technological wave in such a way? 

At the time of writing this ([[2023-W22]]), at the margin I think I am *happier* for BOTH (a) not pursuing a PhD in economics and also (b) not majoring in computer science (though a course of study more in science/theory versus SWE farm may have been cool)
